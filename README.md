# Sowlutions

Sowlutions is a simple text search React project that allows users to search articles and highlights the search terms within them.

## How to Run the Application

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. This will start the development server. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

## How the Application Works

- **`articles.js`**: This file stores an array of articles used in the application.

- **`ArticlesList.js`**: This component filters the articles and displays them based on the search query. It dynamically updates the list of articles based on the user's search input.

- **`SearchBox.js`**: This component handles the search input and button. It allows users to type search terms, triggers the search functionality, and highlights the desired words within the articles.
